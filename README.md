# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project builds and evaluates a **machine learning model** for classifying handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST dataset** — one of the most popular benchmarks in computer vision and deep learning.

Each image in the dataset is a 28×28 grayscale pixel representation of a single digit.  
The goal of this project is to train a model that can accurately recognize these digits from image data.
